## Overview

A console application of a simple number-guessing game implemented in C++17.

The goal is to experiment with [EO Principles](https://www.elegantobjects.org)
with the C++ programming language.

This project is heavily inspired by Yegor's [Elegant
Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html) books.

## Getting Started

You just need to clone and build the application by invoking `Make`.

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/rafamizes/number_guessing_game
  cd number_guessing_game
  make
  ./bin/number_guessing_game
```

**Have fun!**
